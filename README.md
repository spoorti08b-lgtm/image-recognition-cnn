Universal Image Recognition (MobileNetV2 and Gradio)

This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the MobileNetV2 architecture for real-time image recognition.  
It identifies objects, animals, and landmarks with high accuracy using an interactive Gradio web interface.

Features
- Recognizes over 1000 ImageNet categories  
- Built with TensorFlow and Gradio  
- Uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model  
- Fast and easy to execute on any system
